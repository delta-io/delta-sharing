// that are not supported in a safe manner.

// perfrom as much data skipping as possible in the presence of unsupported
// columns types.
//
// The pruning is "safe" as the returned tree is guaranteed to cover a superset
// of data files compared to the original predicate tree.
// For additional details, see:
