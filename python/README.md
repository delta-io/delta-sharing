# Delta Sharing

[Delta Sharing](https://delta.io/sharing) is the industry's first open protocol for secure data sharing, making it simple to share data with other organizations regardless of which computing platforms they use.

This is the Python Connector for Delta Sharing, a Python library that implements the [Delta Sharing Protocol](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing/PROTOCOL.md) to read shared tables from a Delta Sharing Server. You can load shared tables as a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame, or as an [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) DataFrame if running in PySpark with the Apache Spark connector installed.

## Installation and usage

1. Install using `pip install delta-sharing`.
2. To use the Python Connector, see [the project doc](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing) for details.
